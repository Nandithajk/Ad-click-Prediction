**Ad Click Prediction**

**Introduction**

In the world of digital advertising, click prediction plays a pivotal role in determining the success of ad campaigns. Advertisers aim to serve their ads to users who are most likely to engage with them, which makes building an efficient ad click prediction machine learning system crucial.
Ad click prediction, or click-through rate (CTR) prediction, is a machine learning problem that helps determine the success of digital ad campaigns. It predicts the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad based on the ad and the context, such as the user's device, time of day, and search query. Advertisers use this information to show ads to users who are most likely to engage with them, and to price ads, position them, and drive customer engagement.

**Why Ad click is important ?**

A company wants to know the CTR ( Click Through Rate ) in order to identify whether spending their money on digital advertising is worth or not.
A higher CTR represents more interest in that specific campaign, whereas a lower CTR can show that your ad may not be as relevant. High CTRs are important because they show that more people are clicking through to your website. Along with this high CTRs also help to get better ad position for less money on online platforms like Google, Bing etc.
Now we will discuss how to implement ad click prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm.

**Overview**

For this project, a dataset sourced from GitHub is utilized, comprising information on 900 ads and whether customers clicked on them. The dataset includes various features that provide insights into user behavior and ad attributes. These features encompass:

Daily_Time_Spent_on_Site: The amount of time (in minutes) users spend on the website daily.

Age: The age of the user interacting with the ad.

Area_Income: The average income of the area where the user resides.

Daily_Internet_Usage: The amount of time (in minutes) users spend on the internet daily.

Ad_Topic_Line: The headline or topic of the advertisement.

City: The city where the user is located.

Gender: The gender of the user (e.g., male or female).

Country: The country where the user is located.

Timestamp: The timestamp indicating when the ad interaction occurred.

Clicked_on_Ad: A binary variable indicating whether the user clicked on the ad (1) or not (0).

The primary objective of this project is to train a machine learning model using this dataset to predict whether a customer will click on a particular ad. By analyzing the provided features and their relationship with ad clicks, the model aims to accurately forecast user behavior and enhance ad targeting strategies. Through this predictive modeling approach, advertisers can optimize ad placement and resource allocation, ultimately improving campaign effectiveness and maximizing ROI.
